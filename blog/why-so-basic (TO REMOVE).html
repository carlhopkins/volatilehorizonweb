  <h4>Why's this site so basic?</h4>
  <img src="assets/davidguerrero-13252422.jpg" alt="Image (c) David Guerrero"></p>

<div class="style1">
  <p>... or really perhaps you should ask "why is every other site so bloated?"</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> I spend all day building, maintaining, and supporting systems...<br>Id rather be doing cool things in my free time, so GitHub pages does all the backend delivery for me.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Robustness</strong> I subscribe to the <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/" target="_blank">This Page is Designed to Last</a> philosophy.<br>This site is just plain HTML 4.01 with a touch of CSS so as long as you can reach the pages the site should always load.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Compatibility</strong> Hey I love Retro stuff, and I love making old things do new and interesting things that they were never designed for!<br>Want to read this site on your Vintage Macintosh or PC, feel free and any browser should be able to load it - no Javascript or complex frameworks here! <sup>[1]</sup></li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Freedom</strong> The old web was a melting pot of discovery and creativity, commercialisation of the web has killed this off and driven what remained to the fringes of the web.<br>Thankfully many of us want to bring back what made the "old" web great - check out <a href="https://smolweb.org/" target="_blank">SmolWeb</a>, <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>, <a href="https://neocities.org/browse">NeoCities</a>, <a href="https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/faq.gmi" target="_blank">Gemini Protocol</a>, for some great projects!</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Privacy</strong> No need to worry about trackers, bots, etc etc... stealing your personal data. This site collects none, and so do many others like this.<br>Why do I care what desktop you have or browser your using? If something doesn't work im sure someone will tell me eventually, and I might even fix it! <sup>[2]</sup></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Of course there is also the <strong>Fediverse</strong>, with  ActivityPub being probably the only "modern" web protocol thats engineered (at least philosophically) for the user first IMO.</p>
</div>
<div class="style2">
  <p>[1] - Sadly I cant escape the modern SSL/TLS requirement, for this to load in any current browser it must support HTTPS. That said many of the great new/old browsers for you vintage tech have modern TLS support baked in...<br>For those that don't, consider a proxy which strips that nonsense out for you such as <a href="https://github.com/tenox7/wrp" target="_blank">WRP</a> or <a href="https://protoweb.org/" target="_blank">Protoweb</a></p>
  <p>[2] - That said, theres a lot less moving parts in this site and sites like this, so of course breakage is less likely... and whats a broken tag or two between friends!</p>
